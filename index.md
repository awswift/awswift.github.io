## Awswift SDK

[`awswift/Awswift`](https://github.com/awswift/awswift)

The Awswift SDK is a Swift package that wraps the entire suite of Amazon Web Services 
APIs using idiomatic patterns. It runs equally well on iOS and macOS devices as it 
does on Linux servers in the cloud.


## Swiftda

[`awswift/Swiftda`](https://github.com/awswift/swiftda)

Swiftda brings the power and ease-of-use of the Swift programming language to the 
scalability and buzzword-compliance of AWS Lambda. Use the tools you already know 
and love to power the backend of your mobile application.
